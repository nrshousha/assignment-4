## Overview
A simple Go client-server project for learning network communication.

## Files
- `server.go` — server code
- `client.go` — client code
- `go.mod` — Go module file

## How to Run
1. Start the server:
```bash
go run server.go
````

2. In another terminal, run the client:

```bash
go run client.go
```

## Notes

* Make sure the server is running before starting the client.
* Both programs run locally by default.
